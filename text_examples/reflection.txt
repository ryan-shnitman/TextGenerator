My sources were:
1. The Brothers Grimm Fairytales collection
2. War and Peace

I compared them to (and the results were):
1. The Bible (Brothers Grimm)
2. Alice and Wonderland (Brothers Grimm)
3. Great Expectations (Brothers Grimm)
4. Pride and Prejudice (War and Peace)
5. Frankenstein (War and Peace)
6. The Communist Manifesto (War and Peace)

I think these results make sense, and are more or less what I would have predicted. The program could be improved
by improving the stem detection algorithm (as is, it only considers suffixes, but I would have liked to adjust it to handle prefixes without making too many errors) as well as perhaps adjusting the manner in which the sim scores are
weighted; I did it somewhat arbitrarily, but perhaps there is some kind of equation that could be derived that
is more meaningful. In other words, a way to more definitively establish which characteristics are the best
indicators of two texts being derived from the same source.
